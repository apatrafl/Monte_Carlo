# Monte_Carlo
Monte Carlo approximation of pi simulator

The code will calculate the area of a square and circle given a user specifiied radius. Then, using the circle to sqaure proportion of area, will set that proportion as the probability that a point will fall within the circle. Then, the summ of all the points within the circle over the number of points generated in total gives the user an accurate approximation of pi. The accuracy increases the larger number of data points used.
